# Introduction to Embedded Systems

#### Micro-controller unit or MCU

* Basically a CPU with peripherals added into 
    * memory
    * DMF
    * ect... 

#### Chip-Level Embedded Systems

* Better Performance 
* Harder to design
* Much longer to take to market
* Needs more testing
  * FPGA is a good alternative
  * Easy off the shelf parts (don't need to design chips)
  * Performance can be almost as good

#### Chassis Level Embedded Systems

* Circuit boards contained in a chassis connected by a bus on a backplane
* Easily replaced
* Highly Reliable
* Low production Volume

__Fixed the DANG zoom scaling__

Changed `scaleFactor=1` to `scaleFactor=0.65`, zoom was way to large

#### Classical Architecture

#### Performance Metrics

* Power
* Size
* Response Time
* Throughput
* Unit Cost 
* Manageability
* Time to market
* Time to prototype
* Flexibility
* Manufacturing
* Correctness
    - How accurate is the system  
* Safety
